Task: Write a Program to Swap the Values of Two Variables
Objective: Create a Python program that exchanges the values of two variables.

Instructions:
1.Open your coding environment: Use a code editor, IDE, or Python terminal to write your program.
2.Write the code
3.Run the program: Save and execute the code.

Test the program:
  Enter any two values for x and y (e.g., 5 and 10).
  The program should display the original values, swap them, and then show the swapped values.

Example output:
Enter the value of x: 5  
Enter the value of y: 10  
Before swapping: x = 5, y = 10  
After swapping: x = 10, y = 5  

Explanation:
  The input() function collects the values of x and y as strings.
  A temporary variable (temp) is used to hold the value of x while swapping.
  The program prints the values of x and y before and after swapping to show the result.
