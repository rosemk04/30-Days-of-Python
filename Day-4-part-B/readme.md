Task: Write a Program to Print the Sum of Numbers from 1 to 15
Objective: Create a Python program that calculates and prints the sum of numbers from 1 to 15.

Instructions:
1.Open your coding environment: Use a code editor, IDE, or Python terminal to write your program.
2.Write the code
3.Run the program: Save and execute the code.

Test the program:
The program should output:
The sum of numbers from 1 to 15 is: 120

Explanation:
total = 0 initializes the variable to store the running total.
range(1, 16) generates numbers from 1 to 15 (inclusive).
for number in range(1, 16): iterates through these numbers, adding each one to total using the += operator.
The print() function displays the final result.
