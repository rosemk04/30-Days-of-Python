Task: Check Whether a Person is a Minor or an Adult
Objective: Write a Python program that determines if a person is a minor or an adult based on their age.

Instructions:
Open your coding environment: Use a code editor, IDE, or Python terminal to write your program.
Write the code:
Run the program: Save the file and execute it.
Test the program:

Enter an age below 18 (e.g., 16). The program should output:
You are a minor.

Enter an age of 18 or more (e.g., 20). The program should output:
You are an adult.

Explanation:
The input() function collects the user's age as a string, and int() converts it into a number.
The if statement checks if the age is less than 18. If true, it prints "You are a minor."
If the condition is false, the program executes the else block and prints "You are an adult."
