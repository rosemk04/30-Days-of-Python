Task: Create a Python Program to Ask for Name and Age
Objective: Write a Python program that takes the user's name and age as input, then prints a greeting message.

Instructions:
Open your coding environment: Use a code editor, IDE (like PyCharm or VS Code), or a Python terminal.
Write the code
Run the program: Save the file and execute it.
Test the program: Enter your name and age when prompted, and check that the program responds with a personalized greeting like:

Example Output:
What is your name? John
How old are you? 25
Hello, John! You are 25 years old.

Explanation:
The input() function collects user input as a string.
The print() function displays the greeting, using an f-string (f"...") to insert the values of variables directly into the message.
