Task: Calculate BMI Based on User's Weight and Height
Objective: Write a Python program that takes the user's weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI), and displays the result.

Instructions:

1.Open your coding environment: Use a code editor, IDE, or Python terminal to write your program.

2.Write the code: Enter the following Python code into your script:

# Ask the user to enter their weight in kilograms
weight = float(input("Enter your weight (in kg): "))

# Ask the user to enter their height in meters
height = float(input("Enter your height (in meters): "))

# Calculate the BMI
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

# Display the BMI result
print(f"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")

3.Run the program: Save and execute the code.
4.Test the program:

Enter your weight and height (e.g., 70 for weight and 1.75 for height).
•The program should output something like:
Enter your weight (in kg): 70  
Enter your height (in meters): 1.75  
Your BMI is: 22.86

•Explanation:

float(input()): Converts the user's input to a floating-point number to handle decimal values.
BMI Formula: 
BMI=weight (kg)/height (m)²
print(f"{bmi:.2f}"): Displays the BMI rounded to two decimal places.
