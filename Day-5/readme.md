Task: Write a Program to Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Objective: Create a Python program that takes a number as input and determines if it is even or odd.

Instructions:
1.Open your coding environment: Use a code editor, IDE, or Python terminal to write your program.
2.Write the code:
3.Run the program: Save and execute the code.
4.Test the program:
        Enter an even number (e.g., 8). The program should output:
        8 is an even number.
        Enter an odd number (e.g., 5). The program should output:
        5 is an odd number.

Explanation:
int(input()): Converts the user's input into an integer.
number % 2 == 0: Checks if the remainder when dividing the number by 2 is zero (even number).
else: Executes if the number is not even, meaning it is odd.
The print() function displays whether the number is even or odd.
