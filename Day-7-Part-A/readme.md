Task: Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
Objective: Write a Python program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as inputs and calculates its area.

Instructions:
1.Open your coding environment: Use a code editor, IDE, or Python terminal to write your program.
2.Write the code: Enter the following Python code into your script:

# Ask the user for the length and width of the rectangle
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate the area of the rectangle
area = length * width

# Display the area
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")

3.Run the program: Save and execute the code.
4.Test the program:
Enter values for length and width (e.g., 5 and 3).
The program should output:
Enter the length of the rectangle: 5  
Enter the width of the rectangle: 3  
The area of the rectangle is: 15.0

Explanation:
input(): Collects user input as strings, which are converted to floating-point numbers using float().
length * width: Multiplies the length and width to compute the area.
print(): Displays the calculated area with a clear message.
